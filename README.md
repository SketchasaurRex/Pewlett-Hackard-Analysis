# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview Analysis
###The purpose of this analysis is to make it easier to see how many employees are about to retire and their salaries.

##Results
###*The amount of employees soon to retire is now easy to see and count
###*The retirees' salaries are organized and easy to search
###*The possible replacements for soon to be vacant positions are listed and easy to access
###*There's a list for the special titles and who hold those positions

##Summary
###We have organized and created lists for those about to leave the company and those that can potentially fill their vacancies. With these, we see what the retirement salaries will be and expected raises for those that are promoted. Other issues not specifically covered are the vacancies that will be left by those promoted and who will fill those spots. The lists of soon to retire and possible replacements are not one to one, and do not go into detail of who is best for the position. There will need to be interviews for promotion after some further specific requirements are filtered for each position.
